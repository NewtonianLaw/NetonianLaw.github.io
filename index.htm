            Hi, I'm Richard, a software developer. I specialize in creating custom software solutions such as the Pet Boarding and Grooming (PetBaG) system. My work includes designing Java classes, writing pseudocode, and developing flowcharts for efficient software structure and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software's hierarchical design uses conditional logic to handle inputs and decision-making. For example, the Pet class and Dog subclass implement tailored functionalities, ensuring operational efficiency for diverse scenarios.

                Pet Boarding and Grooming (PetBaG) is software tailored to manage operations for dogs, replacing outdated paper-based processes with efficient digital solutions. The system handles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dog check-in and check-out</li>
                <li>Pet management tasks</li>
                <li>Scheduling feeding times and yard activities</li>
                <li>Administrative features like updating pet information and tracking payments</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The software also includes specialized services for pets staying two or more days, ensuring smooth operations within the boarding facility.
