<p style="color: #3498db; font-size: 24px;">Hi I'm Richard! Computer Scientist and Programmer</p>

### About Me
<p style="color: #2ecc71;">As a Computer Science graduate from Southern New Hampshire University, I have cultivated a strong foundation in problem-solving, programming, and algorithms. My academic experience has enhanced my ability to translate concepts into efficient code, organize data effectively using structured algorithms, and create innovative solutions to complex challenges.</p>

### Featured Project: Pet Hotel Management System
<p style="color: #e74c3c;">The Pet Hotel Management System is a capstone project that demonstrates my expertise in software engineering, algorithms, and database management. Originally developed as a Java application, the system was enhanced to support both dogs and cats, showcasing my proficiency in object-oriented programming and software design.</p>

### Software Development Projects:
- <p style="color: #f39c12;">**Software Engineering and Design - Java Implementation**:</p> Developed the Pet class and its Dog and Cats subclass, utilizing constructors, accessors, and methods like `checkIn()`, `checkOut()`, and `updatePet()` to streamline pet management operations.
- <p style="color: #9b59b6;">**Algorithms and Data Structures - Python Adaptation**:</p> Transitioned the system to Python, employing encapsulation, property decorators, and dynamic features to enhance functionality and flexibility.
- <p style="color: #34495e;">**Databases - Data Structures**:</p> Incorporated a Node class and a PetLinkedList class to enable scalable and efficient pet information management.

### Reflection
<p style="color: #1abc9c;">This project reflects my ability to adapt to new programming languages, design robust systems, and solve real-world problems through logical thinking and technical expertise.</p>

### Extended Description
<p style="color: #16a085;">The Pet Hotel Management System began as a basic Java application intended to manage pet boarding operations. Over time, I enhanced its functionality to accommodate both dogs and cats, requiring a complete redesign of the system’s architecture. This process showcased my expertise in object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.</p>

<p style="color: #2980b9;">A key improvement was transitioning the system to Python. This adaptation utilized Python’s dynamic typing and property decorators to simplify code, enhance readability, and improve maintainability. Additionally, I integrated advanced data structures like the Node and PetLinkedList classes, providing a scalable and efficient solution for managing pet records.</p>

<p style="color: #8e44ad;">Throughout the project, I tackled challenges such as ensuring data integrity, optimizing algorithms for performance, and designing intuitive methods like `checkIn()`, `checkOut()`, and `updatePet()` for seamless user interaction. These improvements resulted in a versatile, user-friendly system capable of handling real-world complexities in pet management operations.</p>

<p style="color: #34495e;">This project not only highlights my technical proficiency but also reflects my ability to adapt to new programming languages, solve complex problems, and deliver innovative solutions that align with business needs and user expectations.</p>
