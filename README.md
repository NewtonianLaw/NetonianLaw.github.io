As a junior software developer at Global Rain, I have been involved in developing custom software for Pet Boarding and Grooming (PetBaG), focused on replacing outdated paper processes with a streamlined digital solution. The task includes crafting Java classes, drafting pseudocode, and devising flowcharts. The software structure adopts a hierarchical model, employing conditional logic to handle inputs and drive decision-making processes. Specifically, the Pet class and its Dog subclass are carefully designed to handle diverse functionalities tailored to different pet types, with the flexibility to implement ‘if/else’ statements as needed to navigate various scenarios efficiently. This approach ensures the software operates seamlessly, effectively meeting Pet BAG’s operational needs.
