# Hi, I'm Richard! 👨‍💻 Computer Scientist and Programmer

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I am a **Computer Science graduate** from **Southern New Hampshire University**, with expertise in programming, problem-solving, and software engineering. Below, you'll find an overview of my skills, projects, and reflections.

## 📚 About Me
As a Computer Science graduate, I've built a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithms, and coding. I thrive on creating efficient, scalable software solutions and adapting to new programming languages.

## 🌟 Featured Project: **Pet Hotel Management System**
The **Pet Hotel Management System** is one of my key projects that showcases my skills in **software engineering**, **algorithms**, and **database management**. It started as a **Java-based system** and evolved into a **Python-based solution** for managing both dogs and cats.

### Key Highlights:
- **Java Implementation**: Developed core classes like `Pet`, `Dog`, and `Cat` to manage pet information.
- **Python Adaptation**: Transitioned the system to Python, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
- **Database Integration**: Used advanced data structures like `Node` and `PetLinkedList` for efficient pet record management.

### 🛠 Software Development Projects:
- **Java Implementation**:
  - Developed the `Pet` class and subclasses (`Dog`, `Cat`), and methods like `checkIn()`, `checkOut()`, and `updatePet()`.
- **Python Transition**:
  - Leveraged Python’s features like dynamic typing and property decorators to streamline the system.
- **Advanced Data Structures**:
  - Designed and implemented `Node` and `PetLinkedList` for scalable data management.

## 🎯 Key Skills:
- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Software Engineering**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Design Patterns
- **Database Management**: SQL, Data Structures

## 🧑‍💻 Reflection
This project highlights my ability to:
- Transition between different programming languages.
- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures.
- Design and develop a system that can handle real-world complexity in pet management operations.

## 📝 Extended Description:
The **Pet Hotel Management System** started as a **Java application** for basic pet boarding, but it grew into a full-fledged system to manage both dogs and cats. Transitioning to **Python** allowed me to use its dynamic features to improve maintainability. I also redesigned the system’s architecture to incorporate **advanced data structures**, allowing it to scale efficiently.
